# Splunk Attack Range Cloud ‚öîÔ∏è

## Purpose üõ°
The Attack Range Cloud is a detection development platform, which solves three main challenges in detection engineering. First, the user is able to build quickly a small lab infrastructure as close as possible to a cloud environment. Second, the Attack Range performs attack simulation using different engines such as [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) in order to generate real attack data.
## Building üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Attack Range Cloud can be built is currently:

- **cloud-only**, Specifically simulate attacks against AWS


## Architecture üèØ
The Attack Range Cloud consists of:
- pre-configured Splunk server with AWS Cloudtrail logs and Kubernetes logs
- pre-configured Phantom server
- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service with a Wordpress app and [Splunk Connect for Kubernetes](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-kubernetes)

- integrated [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) cloud attacks

### Logging
The following log sources are collected from the machines:
- Cloudtrail logs (```index=aws```)
- Kubernetes logs (```index=kubernetes```)
- Kubernetes metrics (```index=kubernetes-metrics```)
- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service logs (```index=aws sourcetype=aws:cloudwatchlogs```)
